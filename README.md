# Sublime File Timestamp

Sublime plugin to update filenames with a unix timestamp prefix.

Timestamps are updated to the current time for filenames that already contain a timestamp.

A new timestamp is prepended to filenames without timestamps. \<timestamp>_filename.ext

Intended to provide a convenient way to update CakePHP 2 migration filenames.  

Special thanks to Caius Worthen for inspiring this.
